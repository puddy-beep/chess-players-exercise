                //data only, remember?) and use the method map(). This method sweeps through an object/array
                //attributes/elements and performs actions in each one of them (similar to a loop, but more
                //advanced and with a simpler syntax). We'll call each element "player", followed by a
                //fat arrow, and in this case, generate (render) a list of each players' attributes. 
                //these iterations as list items will all be encapsulated by a <ol> (ordinal list), and
                //...since "player.attribute" (JS) is between the <li> tags (HTML), we need to use the curly braces.
